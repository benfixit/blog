## Learning sources
- Videos.
- Books.
- Documentations.

### Videos
If you want to get started right away, videos are your surest bet. You are limited to the only what the tutor is able to spew out in the duration of the video.

I would advice you go for videos that have the following characteristics:

1. Many views and good reviews
2. Good picture and sound.
4. Videos with practical examples.

### Books
Slow but unarguably the most detailed.
Not all books are better than their video counterpart as such U might want to stick to the books with better reviews and established authors and publishers in that order of importance.

### Documentations
This is unarguably the most detailed piece of material you would ever find for any technology you intend to familiarize yourself with. 
Downside is that it almost always never adopt the tutoring/learning flow of books and videos. Topics are arranged according to different format mostly alphabetically. 
Documentations are very useful when U intend to gain more in depth knowledge of a technology you have already learnt either via books, videos or other knowledge sources. 
They also come in handy when U quickly need to skim through a particular functionality…
In all, try as much as possible to understand the fundamentals of every technology you are using or intend to use and as time goes on, progress into mastering them so as to optimally benefit from it's usage.

### Conclusion
If what is worth doing is what do well and learning is a form of doing, it goes without saying that what is worth learning is worth learning well.
