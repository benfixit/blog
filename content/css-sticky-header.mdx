The most modern and efficient way to create a sticky header with CSS is by using `position: sticky`.

Say, you have the following HTML structure:

```HTML
<header class="sticky_header">
    <nav>
        <!-- Navigation links -->
    </nav>
</header>
<main>
    <!-- Main page content -->
</main>
```

The CSS below will make the header tag sticky.

```CSS
.sticky_header {
    position: sticky; /* Toggles the header between relative and fixed behavior */
    top: 0; /* The point where the element 'sticks' to the viewport */
    padding: 10px 0;
    z-index: 100;    /* Could be any number. It ensures that the header appears above other content */
    width: 100%;      /* Ensures that the headers spans the full width of the viewport */
}
```
