According to the [react documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#whats-a-hook), hooks are functions that lets you "hook into" React features. In this article, we will be discussing about two (2) of those functions, useState and useContext and how you can use them to your advantage while building your React application.

### useState
This is probably the most commonly used hook as it lets you add state to your function components. It effectively does what `this.state and this.setState` does for class components. It accepts an initial value and returns an array of state variable and a function that can be used to set the value of the state variable.

```javascript
import { useState } from "react"
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### useContext
This hook accepts a context object i.e the result from `React.createContext` and returns the current context value in the context.

```javascript
import { useContext, createContext } from "react"
const MyContext = createContext({ count: 0 });
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

## Putting it together
Create a theme context using `createContext`.

```javascript
import { createContext } from "react";

const themes = {
    light: {
        foreground: "#000000",
        background: "#eeeeee"
    },
    dark: {
        foreground: "#ffffff",
        background: "#222222"
    }
}

const DefaultContext = createContext(themes.dark)
```
