# Laravel's Model Binding - Part 1.

Model binding is certainly one of the coolest things in Laravel. Laravel automatically injects a model instance into your route.

Route binding comes in two flavours:
1. Implicit binding
2. Explicit binding


## Implicit Binding:
Laravel automatically resolves Eloquent models that match a route segment. For example, say I have a model called User and a controller called UserController. To get a user, I can define my route as follows:
In my routes file, web.php
```
Route::get('/user/{user}, [
    'uses' => 'UserController@show,
]);
```
In my controller, UserController.php, I can then do:
```
public function show(User $user) {
    return view('show', ['user' => $user]);
}
```
Remember that before now, you had to do:
```
public function show($id) {
    $user = User::findOrFail($id);
    return view('show', ['user' => $user]);
}
```
Well, not anymore, amigo!
NOTE: From `'/user/{user}'`, the route param `'{user}'` has to match the model name `'User'`

It might also interest you to know that Laravel throws a NotFoundException(404) if it doesn't find the model instance in the database.
